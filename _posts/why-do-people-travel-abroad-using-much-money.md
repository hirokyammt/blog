In foreign countries, there are many unusual things, such as language, culture, architecture, art, and food which are stimulating for you in good ways or sometimes bad ways. You would learn something about other countries from them. At the same time, there are many good effects for your usual life by traveling abroad. Everything while traveling is a good experience. Even many bad things that happen while traveling will often be good memories.

First of all, traveling relieves our stress of usual life. For instance, if you love ocean viewing, Hawaiian beaches would make you relax, or if you love Italian foods, you could enjoy authentic Italian meals in Florence; which are completely different from your day-to-day life. Secondly, people can grow by making plans, making reservations, fixing schedules, speaking other languages while traveling overseas. They are very stressful sometimes, but the stress also make you grow for sure, and you will be independent and confident after getting them done. Finally, you will be able to objectively view the country or city you come from by experiencing many unusual things for you. Not only about your homeland, you can learn a lot about yourself as well. When I travel abroad, I always realize some good things of Japan I havenâ€™t thought that it is special and, of course, bad things as well, then I can see how I really feel about them.

To put it simply, people look for stimulating stuff while traveling, which eventually benefits you in many ways. What do you think?
